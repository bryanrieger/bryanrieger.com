<p>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
		  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
	All mimsy were the borogoves,
		  And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

		  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
		  The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>
	
<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
		  Long time the manxome foe he sought—
	So rested he by the Tumtum tree
		  And stood awhile in thought.</p>
